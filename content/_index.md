      title: 'My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My previous and ongoing research focused mainly on efficiently managing high-dimensional (and two-dimensional) systems, hypergraph networks, and healthcare operations. Our group has developed several efficient frameworks for assessing tensor-based system properties. In addition to theoretical research, I actively develop professional skills to work with large-scale real-world data. Upon graduating from UNC, I plan to further explore the practical applications of these theoretical approaches in real-world data during my master's program. 
        I am also open to collaboration, especially in interdisciplinary projects that connect theory with practical impact. ðŸ˜ƒ
