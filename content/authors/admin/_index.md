      Supervised by Prof. Can Chen and Prof. Jingfang Huang
      - Developed and tested a data-driven framework for analyzing T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), providing significant computational improvements over traditional methods requiring tensor unfolding or flattening
      - Proposed a framework for analyzing the controllability of multilinear dynamical systems (MLDSs) using Tucker decomposition and extending Kalman's rank condition, addressing controllability under stochastic noise
      - Analyzed data informativity and stabilization of high-order tensors using T-product or tensor train decompositions
